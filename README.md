# Students-flexibility-in-E-learning-EDA-ML
E-learning is a method of teaching that makes use of technologies to allow for distant connection between students and teachers.
E-learning is the interaction between a teacher and students who are separated by a physical distance. It incorporates all the elements of the educational process (goals, content, organisational structures, and teaching aids) and is carried out using specific Internet technologies or other interactive methods.
